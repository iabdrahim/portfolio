                    I'm abdrahim! Let me tell you a little bit about myself. I'm
                    a 18 years old student belonging to the Homo Sapiens
                    species, a brother, a son, a friend, a self taught web
                    developer and programmer. I was already creating amazing
                    projects using Python back in 11th grade, and started
                    frontend development soon after. So far, I've mastered many
                    languages, including TypeScript, Python, and C++.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Things I do other than dev and programming? Not much, but I
                    enjoy gaming and watching anime.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    That's pretty much everything I know about me yet. In case
                    you know something about me that I still don't, please let
                    me know - I'll add it here.
                </p>
            </div>
        </Container>
    );
}
