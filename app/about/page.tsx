                    <br />
                    I&apos;m abdrahim! Let me tell you a little bit about
                    myself. I&apos;m a 19 years old student belonging to the
                    Homo Sapiens species, a brother, a son, a friend, a self
                    taught web developer and programmer. I was already creating
                    amazing projects using Python back in 11th grade, and
                    started frontend development soon after. So far, I&apos;ve
                    mastered many languages, including TypeScript, Python, and
                    C++.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Things I do other than dev and programming? Not much, but I
                    enjoy gaming and watching anime.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    That&apos;s pretty much everything I know about me yet. In
                    case you know something about me that I still don&apos;t,
                    please let me know - I&apos;ll add it here.
                </p>
            </div>
        </Container>
